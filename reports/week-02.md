- ## 📌 Topics I Focused On

This week, I dove into the world of HTML and CSS to understand how websites actually work behind the scenes. I started by learning the basic structure of an HTML file — things like `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`, and how these pieces come together to form the foundation of any webpage.

I practiced using common HTML tags to build content — headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists. Then I moved on to styling with CSS, learning the difference between inline, internal, and external styles. I also experimented with customizing text — changing fonts, sizes, colors, and even bringing in Google Fonts to make things look nicer.

After that, I built a responsive header using semantic elements like `<header>` and `<nav>`, and used Flexbox to align items cleanly. I explored the CSS box model too — understanding how margins, padding, and borders affect layout.

As the week went on, I learned how to structure the main content of a site using semantic tags like `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<article>`. I played around with both Flexbox and CSS Grid to create layouts, and added media queries to make sure everything looked good on tablets and phones.

Near the end of the week, I created a footer section with links and social icons using Font Awesome, and styled it to be sticky at the bottom of the page. I also started using CSS variables and added some nice hover effects with transitions and pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after`.

To wrap up, I combined everything I learned into my first full personal website — complete with a header, multiple content sections, a footer, and responsive design. I deployed it on GitHub Pages, and wrote a markdown file explaining how the whole site is structured.
