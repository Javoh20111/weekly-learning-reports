# 📅 Day 2: [CSS&HTML&CSS Amalyot]

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Position - Relative, Absolute & Fixed
  {top,right, bottom, left}
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%,-50%):- Helps us to position in center
  z-index: 10; helps to positing box at the top
  @import we can use it importing fonts
  :root{
  --Playfair: 'Playfair Display', serif;
  } thst is the example for how to make fonts easier to copy
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
