# ðŸ“š Weekly Learning Reports

Welcome to my personal learning journal! This repository is where I track everything Iâ€™ve been learning week by week. Each report contains what I studied, challenges, wins, and goals for the following week. This is my way of building a learning history.

## âœ… Goals of this Repository

- Stay consistent with learning
- Reflect on progress and challenges
- Share resources and tips
- Create a personal learning timeline
